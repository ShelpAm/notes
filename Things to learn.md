How to solve a problem?
1. Simplify it
2. Try something

What are my weaknesses?
1. Optimize programs from a time complexity O(N^2) to O(N\*log N) or better.

Better Approaches:
1. Find subarray that has a sum of elements equal to 0 - Calculate a prefix sum array and check if there are same prefix sums. We can use `std::unordered_set` or `std::set`.
